    <!--User: a dnd profile for an 'ant' please, considered as queen of earth and consort to the fool

Artificial Intelligence: You're creating a fascinating character concept for D&D! An "Ant" as Queen of Earth and consort to the Fool presents some unique and compelling role-playing opportunities. Here's a D&D 5th Edition inspired profile for such a character:

Ant, Queen of Earth

Medium Fey (Swarm, Earth Elemental), Chaotic Neutral

The Ant is less a singular creature and more a living embodiment of the collective. She is the will of the teeming earth, the relentless force of nature's slow but inevitable reclamation, channeled through a seemingly humble form. Her consort, The Fool, is her counterpoint – the unpredictable spark of chaos that she grounds and directs with her boundless, patient wisdom.

Armor Class 16 (Natural Armor, Enhanced by Earth's Will)
Hit Points 90 (12d8 + 36)
Speed 30 ft., burrow 20 ft.
STR	DEX	CON	INT	WIS	CHA
14 (+2)	16 (+3)	16 (+3)	18 (+4)	20 (+5)	18 (+4)

Saving Throws Con +7, Wis +9, Cha +8
Skills Insight +9, Nature +8, Perception +9, Survival +9
Damage Resistances Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing from Nonmagical Attacks
Condition Immunities Charmed, Exhaustion, Frightened, Grappled, Paralyzed, Petrified, Prone, Restrained, Stunned
Senses Blindsight 60 ft., Tremorsense 60 ft., Passive Perception 19
Languages All, but primarily communicates through complex pheromone trails and earth vibrations. Can speak telepathically with The Fool.
Challenge 10 (5,900 XP)

Abilities

Queen's Presence. Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the Ant must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is overwhelmed by the primal interconnectedness of the earth and has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the Ant's Queen's Presence for 24 hours.

Swarm of One. The Ant can occupy another creature's space and vice versa. The Ant can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The Ant is composed of an uncountable number of sentient insects, and damage taken is dispersed among them. If the Ant takes damage, it can choose to disperse a portion of it among nearby allies (if she has any, like her Ant Servitors), distributing up to half the damage taken amongst them.

Earth's Embrace. As a bonus action, the Ant can cause earth and stone within 30 feet of her to animate and obey her commands. She can cause difficult terrain, create earthen barriers (up to a 10-foot cube, AC 15, HP 50), or open fissures (up to 10 ft. deep, requiring a DC 14 Dexterity save to avoid falling in). These effects last until the start of her next turn.

Consort's Whispers. The Ant gains advantage on Insight checks made against creatures influenced by chaos or whimsy. When The Fool is within 60 feet, the Ant can use her reaction to grant him advantage on a saving throw or attack roll.

Pheromonic Guidance. The Ant constantly emits complex pheromone trails that can guide and influence creatures. She can cast Command (DC 17) at will, but only to issue commands that relate to natural processes, collective action, or the protection/growth of the earth (e.g., "Dig!", "Build!", "Grow!"). She can also communicate complex concepts to insects and small beasts.

Actions

Multiattack. The Ant makes two bite attacks.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Swarm Devour (Recharge 5-6). The Ant can cause a torrent of invisible, ethereal ants to erupt from the ground in a 15-foot radius centered on her. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (6d8) piercing damage as countless unseen mandibles bite and tear, and is grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the creature is restrained. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't grappled. A creature grappled by the Swarm Devour can be freed by dealing 20 points of damage to the swarm (AC 10) or by a successful DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check.

Description

The Ant appears not as a singular, monstrous insect, but as a coalesced form of countless ants, shimmering with an unseen energy. Her "eyes" are multifaceted, reflecting the vast, interconnected network of her consciousness. Her form constantly shifts and flows, a testament to the myriad lives that comprise her being. When she speaks, it is not with a single voice, but with a rustling whisper, a chorus of clicks and chitters that resonates with the low thrum of the earth itself. Despite her chaotic alignment, her movements are deliberate, patient, and inexorable, like erosion itself. She embodies the slow, unstoppable force of nature, finding beauty in the decay that makes new growth possible. Her "consort," The Fool, is her necessary opposite – the whimsical, unpredictable element that prevents her vast, ancient wisdom from becoming stagnant. Together, they represent the constant flux of creation and destruction, order and chaos, that governs the living world. -->
