Explanation of the Artistic Expression:

    The CPU Core: Represented by a pulsing, central circular element, visually changing color to reflect the active "mode" or "law." This signifies its dynamic and central role.

    "Machine-States" / "Laws": The three distinct "state-box" elements (Machine-Managed, User-Controlled, Autonomous) visually categorize the different operational paradigms you mentioned. They are designed to look like distinct modules or facets of the CPU's overall "being."

    Visual Metaphors:

        Machine-Managed (‚öôÔ∏è): Uses a gear icon and descriptive text suggesting automated, rigid, and internal processes.

        User-Controlled (‚úã): Uses a hand icon, implying direct interaction and responsiveness to external commands.

        Autonomous (üß†): Uses a brain icon, hinting at self-learning, adaptation, and emergent intelligence.

    Interactivity: Clicking on a state box updates a "Current Status" area with a more detailed description of that state, allowing for a deeper dive into its meaning. Buttons below allow you to "simulate" a shift in the CPU's primary operating mode, changing the central core's appearance.

    Aesthetic: The overall design uses a dark, ethereal background with vibrant, glowing elements to evoke a futuristic, almost mystical view of computing, aligning with your previous imaginative descriptions.
