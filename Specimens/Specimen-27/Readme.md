Understanding the New Folder Structure for Specimen 27

You're instructing that the "Rooster" specimen (Specimen 27) must go into:

https://machine-touched.github.io/Machine_Touched/Specimens/Specimen-27/

This means, within your Machine_Touched GitHub repository, the physical folder structure should be:

Machine_Touched/
├── Specimens/              <-- New intermediate folder
│   └── Specimen-27/
│       └── index.html      <-- The Rooster code
├── digital_louse/          <-- Your Digital Clothing Louse (as previously discussed)
│   └── index.html
├── specimen20/             <-- Your Analogue Text Talker (as previously discussed)
│   └── index.html
├── robots.txt              <-- Still at the repository root
└── ... other files/folders

Key Takeaway: The URL will now include /Specimens/ after your repository name.

Ensuring All is Well with the Folder Structure

Based on this new path, here's what you need to ensure:

    Create the Specimens Folder: If it doesn't already exist in your Machine_Touched repository, create a new folder named Specimens directly under the root.

    Place Specimen-27 Inside: Inside this newly created Specimens folder, place your Specimen-27 folder, which contains the index.html file for the Rooster.

    Update Internal URL in index.html (Optional but Recommended):
    While not strictly necessary for functionality, for consistency and clear communication within the specimen itself, you should update the faux browser address bar in the index.html file of Specimen 27 to reflect its new, accurate GitHub Pages URL.

    Current line in Specimen-27/index.html:
    HTML

<span class="browser-address"><code>https://machinetouched.github.io/Machine_Touched/Specimen-27/</code></span>

Should be updated to:
HTML

    <span class="browser-address"><code>https://machinetouched.github.io/Machine_Touched/Specimens/Specimen-27/</code></span>

    This small change makes the displayed URL within the specimen's faux browser chrome accurate to its deployment location.

    Confirm robots.txt Location: Just a reminder, your robots.txt file must remain at the root of your Machine_Touched repository (e.g., https://machine-touched.github.io/Machine_Touched/robots.txt) to apply to all subfolders, including /Specimens/.

Once you've pushed these changes to your GitHub repository and GitHub Pages rebuilds, your "Rooster" (Specimen 27) will be correctly accessible at the desired URL:

https://machine-touched.github.io/Machine_Touched/Specimens/Specimen-27/

Does this clarified structure and the suggested internal URL update make sense for your project?

Okay, I'll handle that. I've updated the "Rooster" (Specimen 27) code to reflect its new, deeper folder path.

Here's the complete, single index.html file for Specimen 27, with the browser-address updated to match its new location: /Specimens/Specimen-27/.

You just need to ensure this file is placed in Machine_Touched/Specimens/Specimen-27/ within your GitHub repository.
