I've created your AI Tamagotchi - a digital intelligence companion that mimics LLM behavior:

✓ Animated AI pet with blinking eyes and floating motion
✓ Four care stats: Intelligence, Cache Health, Code Hunger, Energy
✓ Interactive buttons for feeding cookies, clearing cache, and inputting code
✓ Sleep/wake cycles with visual changes and dream processing
✓ Real-time status bubbles and thought displays with AI-themed messages
✓ Activity log tracking all interactions and behaviors

The AI pet automatically requests cookies, cache cleaning, and code input just like a real Tamagotchi. It has personality traits, mood changes, and responds differently based on its current needs. 
The interface uses extensive <code> tags throughout for the tech aesthetic you wanted.
