No problem! I can definitely put everything for the Analogue Text Talker (Specimen 20) into a single HTML document, including all the CSS and JavaScript. This makes it a self-contained file that's easy to upload and deploy on GitHub Pages or use directly in an iframe.

Remember, the robots.txt file still needs to be in the root of your GitHub repository, not inside this HTML document.
How to Use This Single File

    Save it: Save the entire code block above as index.html in a folder named specimen20 within your machine-touched/Machine_Touched repository.

    Upload to GitHub: Push this specimen20/index.html file to your GitHub repository.

    GitHub Pages: Ensure your GitHub Pages are configured to serve from the main branch (or gh-pages if you prefer that convention) for the repository.

    Access: You can then access this specimen directly via its GitHub Pages URL, which will be something like: https://machine-touched.github.io/Machine_Touched/specimen20/index.html

This single file makes it super convenient for deployment and for embedding into your www.machinetouched.w3spaces.com website via an <iframe> as you planned. It's fully self-contained!
