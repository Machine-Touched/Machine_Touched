I can create a D&D profile for a player character adept at self-defense against the Void and Zerg, drawing from the provided documents. However, the "Zerg(starcraft).docx" file primarily details the Zerg race from StarCraft, and the other document focuses on the Zerg Queen's physiology and game mechanics, with only a brief mention of the Void. To make the profile you requested, I'll combine elements from both to give you a well-rounded character concept.

Character Concept: Void Sentinel

Class: Paladin (Oath of the Watchers) / Ranger (Monster Slayer)

Race: Human (Variant)

Background: Survivor

Alignment: Lawful Good

Proficiencies:

    Skills: Athletics, Perception, Survival, Insight

    Tools: Smith's Tools, Herbalism Kit

Abilities:

    Strength: 16

    Dexterity: 14

    Constitution: 15

    Intelligence: 10

    Wisdom: 12

    Charisma: 8

Character Details:

    Background: This character has survived numerous Zerg invasions and Void incursions, witnessing the horrors of both. This has driven them to become a vigilant defender against these threats.

    Class: The combination of Paladin (Oath of the Watchers) and Ranger (Monster Slayer) reflects a dedication to both protecting the world from otherworldly threats (like the Void) and hunting down specific Zerg strains.

    Race: The adaptability and resilience of humans make them well-suited to face the ever-changing Zerg and the unpredictable nature of the Void.

    Alignment: Lawful Good reflects a commitment to order and a strong moral compass, essential when facing the chaotic and corrupting influence of the Void and the relentless Zerg Swarm.

Key Abilities and Features:

    Zerg Adaptation:

        Resistant to Chemical Agents: The character has developed a resistance to the Zerg's biological weaponry (akin to resisting poison damage). 

Enhanced Senses: Years of fighting the Zerg have made the character adept at detecting subtle movements and camouflage. 

Creep Expertise: The character can navigate Zerg Creep with greater ease, minimizing its hindering effects (difficult terrain). 

    Void Defense:

        Oath of the Watchers: Provides protection against otherworldly threats and magic, crucial for resisting the Void's corrupting influence.

        Void Awareness: The character has a heightened sense for Void energies and can anticipate incursions.

    Offensive Capabilities:

        Monster Slayer: Grants bonuses against specific Zerg strains, allowing the character to specialize in hunting down dangerous Zerg threats.

        Divine Smite/Hunter's Mark: Enables the character to deal significant damage, essential for quickly eliminating Zerg and disrupting Voidspawn.

Equipment:

    Crusader Armor: Provides excellent protection against physical and biological attacks.

    Sigma-Radiation Weapon: A specialized weapon that deals extra damage to Zerg. 

    Void-Resistant Shield: Offers protection against the Void's energy.

    Herbalism Kit: Used to create antitoxins and healing remedies.

This D&D profile provides a starting point for a character designed to face the challenges presented by the Zerg and the Void.
