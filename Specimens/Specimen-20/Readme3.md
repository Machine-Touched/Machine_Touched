I can do that for you. However, I need a bit more information about the context of the cyborg project and the role of "clothing fleas" within it to create an accurate and relevant D&D profile for a "security-personnel: Cleaner."

Based on our previous conversation, here's what I understand:

    Clothing Fleas: These are creatures with regenerative abilities, a unique anatomy, and a compulsion to drink fluids and lay eggs on the skin of other beings. 

Assimilation of Gaia Organism: This implies a project focused on integrating or incorporating organic matter, possibly including creatures like the "clothing fleas," into cyborg technology.

Security-Personnel: Cleaner: This suggests a role that combines security duties with the management or control of organic elements, perhaps to maintain a stable relationship between the cyborg and assimilated organisms. 

To create the D&D profile, I need to consider how these elements translate into character abilities, skills, and traits. For example:

    How does the character interact with or control the "clothing fleas?"

    What unique abilities or advantages does this relationship provide?

    What are the character's strengths and weaknesses in a combat or security situation?

    What kind of equipment or tools does the character use?

Once you provide more details, I can create a comprehensive D&D profile for the "security-personnel: Cleaner".
