How to use it:

    Save the entire code block above as an index.html file.
    Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.
    You will see the "Simple Computer Emulator" interface.
    The Code Editor textarea contains a sample program:

    MOV A,5
    ADD A,3
    OUT A
    MOV B,10
    SUB B,2
    OUT B

    Click the "Run Program" button to execute the code.
    The Registers, Memory, and Output sections will update to show the state of the emulator and the program's output.

You can modify the code in the Code Editor textarea to write your own simple programs using the MOV, ADD, SUB, and OUT instructions, 
and then run them to see the results. This gives you a tangible "computer specimen" that you can directly interact with and observe.
