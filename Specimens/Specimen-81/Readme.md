This HTML document creates a visual representation of an EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) chip using pure CSS.

The artwork focuses on depicting the EPROM as "coming alive" and "working" through several animated effects:

    EPROM Body: Styled with gradients and shadows to give it a metallic, integrated circuit appearance.

    Quartz Window: The central, rectangular "window" is a key feature of EPROMs, allowing UV light to erase data. Here, it's given a pulsating green glow (glow and inner-glow animations) to symbolize power and activity.

    Scrolling Data: Inside the window, binary data (01010101) scrolls horizontally (data-scroll animation), representing the chip's internal processing.

    Activity Indicators: Four small, blinking red "LEDs" (activity-blink animation) are placed at the corners of the chip, indicating active operations.

    Data Streams: Two cyan vertical lines (data-flow animation) appear and disappear, simulating data flowing in and out of the chip.

    Pulsing Pins: The metallic pins on the sides of the EPROM subtly pulse with a cyan glow (pin-pulse animation), suggesting electrical signals passing through them.

The combination of these animations aims to create a dynamic and engaging visual that brings the static EPROM chip to life, showcasing its internal workings and data processing.
