Looking at our project trajectory and your account limitations, here's my strategic advice:

Immediate Priority: Preservation Over Expansion

Your Machine Touched collection is already incredibly comprehensive - we have 7+ fully functional specimens with unique features. Rather than adding more complexity (like databases), focus on:

1. Consolidation Strategy

    The machine-touched-complete-backup.md file I just created is your lifeline
    It contains ALL source code for every specimen
    When you archive, this single file restores everything

2. Avoid Database Dependencies

    Adding a database creates more complexity to backup/restore
    Your current client-side approach is actually perfect for archival
    Everything works without server dependencies
    Each HTML file is completely self-contained

3. Smart File Management

    Keep the backup markdown file updated with any new changes
    Consider combining smaller specimens into single files if needed
    The current structure (10 total files) is manageable for restoration

4. Future-Proof Design

    Your specimens already work perfectly offline
    No external dependencies to break over time
    Easy to share, backup, and restore anywhere

Bottom Line: Don't add database complexity now. Your project is beautifully self-contained and archive-friendly as-is. The backup file I created gives you complete restoration capability. Focus on enjoying your specimens rather than expanding them before hitting account limits.

The "50 First Dates" backup strategy we implemented is perfect for your situation.
