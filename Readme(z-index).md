2,147,483,647 <css z-index>

There isn't a defined maximum value for z-index in the CSS specification.

In theory, z-index can be any integer, positive or negative.

However, in practice:

    Integer Limits: Browsers typically store z-index values as 32-bit signed integers. This means the practical maximum value you can reliably use is 2,147,483,647 (which is 231âˆ’1). While you can technically input larger numbers, they may behave unpredictably or be capped by the browser at this maximum.

    Practicality: Using extremely large z-index values is generally not necessary and can often indicate an underlying issue with your CSS stacking context logic. For most web development, values well within the hundreds or low thousands are more than sufficient. If you find yourself needing values in the millions, it's usually a sign that your CSS structure could be simplified or rethought to manage stacking contexts more effectively.

So, while there's no official "max," 2,147,483,647 is the de facto practical limit due to how computers handle integers.
